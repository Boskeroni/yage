### GAMEBOY EMULATOR

This is a gameboy emulator built using rust as my A-level Computer Science NEA project. 
Once my grade for it has been finalised I will post the associated write-up that details what I learned to make this emulator.

# TODOs
* Implement a sound system
* Implement a save file system
* Upgrade this emulator into a Gameboy Color Emulator
