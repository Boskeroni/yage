# GAMEBOY EMULATOR

This is a gameboy emulator built using rust as my A-level Computer Science NEA project. 
Once my grade for it has been finalised I will post the associated write-up that details what I learned to make this emulator.

### TODOs
I'm not sure when i will have the motivation to come back to this project but when I do, these things i will implement

* Implement a sound system
* Implement a save file system
* Upgrade this emulator into a Gameboy Color Emulator
* Swap out current implementation of DMA transfer for more accurate one.
